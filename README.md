# strataway
Strataway is a logic-driven navigation system that helps students turn goals into clear, realistic paths. Instead of giving generic advice or one rigid plan, Strataway breaks growth into structured layers—skills, milestones, and time-bound actions—so users always know what to do next and why it matters.
